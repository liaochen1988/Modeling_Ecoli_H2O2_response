This programs simulate the metabolic changes with respect to DO level in wild-type E. coli.

Initial_Concentration.m describes initial concentrations of metabolite and protein.

Kinetic_model.m describes kinetic equations and mass balances.

Parameter.m describes kinetic parameters and total concentrations of TF and cofactor.

Plot_effect_of_DO_level.m calls ode15s solver and draws figures.


For simulations, run 'Plot_effect_of_DO_level.m'.
