Alim:
    Plots of relative protein expression data for 898 proteins under A-limitation. A html file "all_Alim_plots.html" is included to show all the plots in a single web page.

Clim:
    Plots of relative protein expression data for 856 proteins under C-limitation. A html file "all_Clim_plots.html" is included to show all the plots in a single web page.

Rlim:
    Plots of relative protein expression data for 756 proteins under R-limitation. A html file "all_Rlim_plots.html" is included to show all the plots in a single web page.

Data points on each plot are the relative expression level (U/L, or Unlabeled peptide over Labeled peptide) for peptides, with the number of peptides in a condition indicated as the corresponding number on the plot. The protein level is taken as the median value of the peptide values and the two quartiles are taken as the errors. See Supplementary Text 1 for details.
